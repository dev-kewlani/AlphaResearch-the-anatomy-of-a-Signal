# Quantitative Alpha Research: The Anatomy of a Signal

## 1. Project Vision

This repository houses a collaborative research project for the FIM 500 course at NC State University. Our primary mission is to build a comprehensive framework for the systematic discovery, engineering, and rigorous validation of alpha signals in financial markets.

While many quantitative projects focus solely on the final backtest, our core focus is on the foundational and most critical step: **feature engineering**. We will explore the "anatomy" of a predictive signal, from its theoretical inception in academic literature to its practical implementation and statistical validation. The goal is to create a robust "factory" for generating and testing financial hypotheses, with a secondary emphasis on building a lightweight backtesting module to evaluate our most promising discoveries.

## 2. Core Learning Objectives

This project is designed as a deep dive into the end-to-end process of a quantitative researcher. By the end of this semester, team members will have gained hands-on experience in:

-   **Alpha Generation:** Systematically creating and implementing a diverse library of potential alpha signals based on financial and economic intuition.
-   **Feature Engineering:** Transforming raw market data (price, volume, etc.) into predictive features using mathematical and statistical techniques.
-   **Comprehensive EDA:** Conducting in-depth exploratory data analysis to understand data regimes, distributions, and potential relationships.
-   **Signal Validation:** Applying rigorous statistical methods (e.g., Information Coefficient, quantile analysis, turnover analysis) to validate a signal's predictive power and avoid common pitfalls.
-   **Literature Review:** Reading and interpreting seminal academic papers in quantitative finance to inform our research.
-   **Python for Quant Finance:** Mastering key libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `polars`, `dask`) for financial data analysis and modeling.
-   **Collaborative Development:** Using Git and GitHub for version control and effective teamwork.

## 3. The Research Pipeline

Our methodology will follow a structured, scientific process:

1.  **Data Sourcing & Integration:** Identify and procure historical market data across various asset classes.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the statistical properties of the data to inform our feature engineering process.
3.  **Feature Engineering ("The Factory"):** Develop a categorized library of functions to generate signals (e.g., momentum, mean-reversion, volatility).
4.  **Rigorous Signal Validation:** Test each individual signal for predictive power, statistical significance, and robustness. This is the core of our research.
5.  **Portfolio Construction & Backtesting:** Combine the most promising signals into a multi-factor model and evaluate its performance in a simple backtesting environment.
